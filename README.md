This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to predict and visualize stock prices for FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google). By selecting a company and entering stock parameters like Opening Price, High Price, Low Price, Adjusted Close, and Volume, users can predict the closing stock price using pre-trained machine learning models. The app also visualizes the predicted price alongside historical stock price data for better insights.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Company Selection:** Predict stock prices for specific FAANG companies.  
2. **Parameter Input:** Input stock data such as Opening Price, High Price, Low Price, etc.  
3. **Prediction:** Display the predicted closing price using machine learning models.  
4. **Visualization:** Plot historical stock prices and overlay the predicted price for comparison.  
5. **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly, interactive web app built with Python and Streamlit.  

This project is ideal for stock market enthusiasts and analysts looking for quick insights into FAANG stock trends and predictions.
